# Moonlight App

**Moonlight** is a headless (GUI-less) Python application that automates the monitoring of Telegram channels. Its goal is to help you detect and forward relevant messages (such as prices, alerts, or specific keywords) to your own channel using a Telegram bot.

## üí°What does Moonlight do?

- Scans public Telegram channels or groups for user-defined keywords.
- Sends an alert to the user‚Äôs Telegram channel when a match is found.
- Automatically forwards messages that meet the configured criteria.
- Runs unattended, ideal for cloud environments (AWS, Azure, VPS).
